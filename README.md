# Unity Firefighting Simulation

# Overview, Purpose, and Features

Interactive Fire Suppression Simulation

Experience realistic firefighting with a dynamic firetruck hose and aerial wildfire control in a detailed virtual environment.
Fly a firefighting jet across a virtual forest and suppress spreading wildfires using Phos-Chek drops.

The purpose of this project is to provide a Modular and Immersive Simulation (MIS) of firefighting scenarios.
The simulation accounts for various inputs and outputs, whether you have a full racing sim setup and VR headset or just a keyboard and monitor.
The experiences can also provide haptic feedback via the bHaptics TactGlove and TactSuit.

# Maintenance

This application is not a service, so it does not require active maintenance to function. Simply download the release and run it.

# Troubleshooting

## Input does not work

Keyboard/controller input occasionally does not work. Restarting the application fixes this. For controllers, make sure all of them are plugged in.

## The program crashes

Cesium seems to cause occasional random crashes. We cannot control this. Restart the program to fix.
