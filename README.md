# Unity Firefighting Simulation

## Overview, Purpose, and Features

Interactive Fire Suppression Simulation

Experience realistic firefighting with a dynamic firetruck hose and aerial wildfire control in a detailed virtual environment.
Fly a firefighting jet across a virtual forest and suppress spreading wildfires using Phos-Chek drops.

The purpose of this project is to provide a Modular and Immersive Simulation (MIS) of firefighting scenarios.
The simulation accounts for various inputs and outputs, whether you have a full racing sim setup and VR headset or just a keyboard and monitor.
The experiences can also provide haptic feedback via the bHaptics TactGlove and TactSuit.
